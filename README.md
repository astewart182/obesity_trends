# obesity_trends 

As a public health researcher, I believe obesity is one of the most important issues this world currently faces. 

Here in the US, obesity is an epedemic and has offically been declared a public health crisis.

The goal of this analsyis is to better understand the trend of rising obesity here in the US, and also compare rates from multiple major countries around the world to see how we compare to each other.

The data used for this analysis was downloaded directly from the World Health Organization, and includes data from year 1975 to year 2016.
